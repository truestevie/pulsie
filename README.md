# pulsie
Count and transmit number of pulses detected on digital input of a NodeMCU.
## Typical usage
Keep track of household water usage by "listening" to an analogue water counter using a reed switch.
## Objectives
* Set up a WIFI connection to an access point.
* Monitor the status of a digital input port. 
* Debounce the digital input port by adding a debounce timer to the logic.
* Keep track of the number of pulses detected on the input port.
* Send the number of pulses - counted during the latest monitoring period - to an InfluxDB server.
* Use the onboard LEDs to indicate the WIFI connection status, detection of pulses and the upload to InfluxDB server.

## To do
* Check if NodeMCU is by default programmed to enter a light sleep mode, possibly causing it to miss the first set of pulses after a long "pulse-less" period of time.
